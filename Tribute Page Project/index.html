      <p>Dr. John Zoidberg, “M”D. is quite possibly the funniest character on Futurama. You probably quote him at least ten times a day, and if you don’t, you should. Now then, let’s take a look at 20 immortal quotes from everyone’s favorite medical
        crab.<br>
        <br>

        1. “Your music’s bad and you should feel bad!”<br>
        From “The Devil’s Hands Are Idle Playthings,” giving Fry the cold hard truth when his opera goes south without his magical robot devil hands.<br>
        <br>
        2. “I’m swelling with patriotic mucus!”<br>
        From “A Taste Of Freedom,” when he gets a little too into the Freedom Day celebration.<br>
        <br>
        3. “By the way, I took the liberty of fertilizing your caviar.”<br>
        From “Where The Buggalo Roam,” when he had no problem making himself at home at the Wong Ranch.<br>
        <br>
        4. “You’ll never guess where I’ve been!”<br>
        From “Parasites Lost,” when the Planet Express crew is inside Fry’s body, and he emerges riding a giant… well, you know.<br>
        <br>

        5. “I saw a frilly cake in here you’d remember all your life. I know I will. Every night it haunts me with its frosted beauty. Order the cake<br>, dammit!”
        From “Bend Her,” when he’s planning Bender (as Coilette) and Calculon’s wedding, and one cake really catches his eye.<br>
        <br>
        6. “On margin! Zoidey wanna buy on margin!”<br>
        From “The Day The Earth Stood Stupid,” when a momentarily stupefied Zoidberg forgets the cause of the 1929 stock market crash.<br>
        <br>
        7. “Two oil changes for the price of one! Now if I could afford the one, and the car.”<br>
        From “Insane In The Mainframe,” slowly realizing just how useless his Planet Express anniversary gift is.<br>
        <br>
        8. “Ah, there’s nothing like the first cup of dumpster juice in the morning!”<br>
        From “Stench And Stenchibility,” starting his day the right way as always.<br>
        <br>
        9. “Why always the fighting?”<br>
        From “Bender Gets Made,” after shot full of whatever the 31st Century equivalent of morphine is makes him perfectly sedate.<br>
        <br>
        10. “Congratulations! I assume Amy is the father.”<br>
        From “The Problem Is Popplers,” when a fully-grown poppler calls Leela “mama.” Remember, he’s an expert on humans, not robits.<br>
        <br>
        11. “Earth, what a planet! On Earth, you enjoy eating a tasty clam. On my planet, clams enjoy eating a tasty you!”<br>
        From “That’s Lobstertainment,” trying stand-up with a hacky Yakov Smirnoff rip-off. It doesn’t go over well.<br>
        <br>
        12. “I ate garbage yesterday, and it didn’t cost me 300 dollars!”<br>
        From “300 Big Boys,” not understanding why rich folks love goose liver and caviar so much. Why even bother fertilizing it!<br>
        <br>
        13. “I’m looking for something beautiful and cheap for a lady who is one of those things!”<br>
        From “Stench And Stenchibility,” buying a flower for his special gal. In the end, he’d wind up with the flower girl instead, because she saw past his horrible stench to his beautiful soul. <br>
        <br>
        14. “Help! A guinea pig tricked me!”<br>
        From “Anthology Of Interest I,” when, well, a guinea pig tricks him.<br>
        <br>
        15. “What? It’s not even scratch and sniff? But if rich people think it’s good, I’ll buy it. One art, please!”<br>
        From “300 Big Boys,” not totally understanding the art world.<br>
        <br>
        16. “You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?”<br>
        From “Why Must I Be A Crustacean In Love.” This is his idea of flirting, but hey, she takes it as a compliment. Maybe Zoidberg is onto something.<br>
        <br>
        17. “I wonder what the Shroud Of Turin tastes like.”<br>
        From “A Taste Of Freedom.” It’s quite possible that Zoidberg plans on eating every historical document in existence. And I have no problem with that.<br>
        <br>

        18. “My name isn’t slick, it’s Zoidberg. JOHN F***ING ZOIDBERG!<br>
        From “The Silence Of The Clamps,” letting Francis know he tangled with the wrong guy.<br>
        <br>

        19. “Hooray, I’m useful!”<br>
        From “Mother’s Day,” when his can opening skills come in handy during the robot rebellion.<br>
        <br>

        20. “Whoop! Whoop! Whoop!”<br>
        He pretty much says this in every episode.<br>
        <br>
